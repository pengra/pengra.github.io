Maps that do not fulfill these conditions are not considered a part of the solution set. Each condition can be described with a simple true or false . A district cannot be separated into two parts; all precincts in a district must be directly bordering another precinct in the same district. Definition Solution Set : the set of valid district maps. For a district map to be \"good\", it must fulfill the following conditions. Maps that do not fulfill these conditions are still a part of the solution set. Each condition can be described with a numerical value. A district is geographically compact, as in the ratio between area to perimeter is maximized. A district represents the population fairly. For instance, if a state has n n districts, each state should have roughly 1\\over{n} 1\\over{n} th of the population in each district. Step 1: Represent Precincts as Graph Nodes The first step is to construct a graph, where each node represents a precinct, where an edge is placed between two nodes if they're physically bordering each other. Let the ordered list g g represent the graph, where g_i g_i is the i i th precinct in the graph. Step 2: Attach Meta Data to Vertexes Each node (precinct) has meta data, specifically population and geographical compactness. Let the ordered list p p represent populations, where p_i p_i describes the population of g_i g_i . Similarly, let d d be an ordered list, where d_i d_i notes which district g_i g_i is in. Future Expansion Meta data is designed for expansion, which allows for maps to be analyzed under further lens. For instance, demographic data may be of interest. Step 3: Define Graph Scoring Methodology The graph, g g , - and given the meta data defined in p p and d d - is now able to be scored. A score is defined in such a way to describe the \"good\"ness of g g . Compactness Score The goal is to rate a graph with long snaking districts poorly; or create a scoring system that is maximized when the area to perimeter ratio is maximized. In g g , an area of a district is defined by the number of nodes it contains. A perimeter, is defined by the number of edges that connect the district and different districts. Example: Area A district's area is defined by the number of nodes in g g that is a part of the specified district. For instance, in the simple graph below, district A would have an area of 3. A---A---C | | | B---A---C | | | B---B---C Example: Perimeter A district's perimeter is defined by the number of edges that connect thie district in question and another district that isn't the same district. For instance, in the simple graph below, district A would have a perimeter of 5. A---A---C | | | B---A---C | | | B---B---C The compactness score of g g should ideally rate district borders with long snaking patterns poorly. Such a scoring method could be defined as the inverse of: C(g) = \\sum^{\\text{districts}} {{{\\text{perimeter}}^2}\\over{\\text{area}}} C(g) = \\sum^{\\text{districts}} {{{\\text{perimeter}}^2}\\over{\\text{area}}} Inversing Ideally, the higher this score the more \"good\" g g is. This score encourages districts to take the shape of circles. C(g) C(g) currently rates long snaking districts higher than circular districts, so when combining the scores the inverse of C(g) C(g) must be taken. Population Balance Score Population balance scores are measured in standard deviations. Given g g and p p , the standard deviation of the total population is the following: \\sigma(g)^2 = {1\\over{|g| - 1}} \\sum_{i = 1}^{|G|} {(p_i - \\bar{p})^2} \\sigma(g)^2 = {1\\over{|g| - 1}} \\sum_{i = 1}^{|G|} {(p_i - \\bar{p})^2} Inversing Ideally, the lower this score the more \"good\" g g is. \\sigma(g) \\sigma(g) currently scores graphs with more district population variances favorably, so when combining the scores the inverse of \\sigma(g) \\sigma(g) must be taken. Combination As mentioned earlier, the scoring functions \\sigma \\sigma and C C must be inversed to accurately describe \"good\"ness of g g . Additionally, each component of \\text{score}(g) \\text{score}(g) is given a weight, notated as \\alpha \\alpha and \\beta \\beta . \\text{score}(g) = \\exp{(-(\\alpha C(g) + \\beta \\sigma (g)))} \\text{score}(g) = \\exp{(-(\\alpha C(g) + \\beta \\sigma (g)))} The range of the score will be between 0 and 1. Step 4: Define a Walk Definition Let G G be a graph where each edge represents some redistricting g g . An edge between two edges represents one precinct on one border changing districts. We then utilize the Metropolis Algorithm 1 to a walk. Initial State We start with a random g g and set t = 0 t = 0 . Note Typically, our \"random\" g g is a one we achieved from a previous walk. Iteration Algorithm We select a random new redistricting named g' g' . This is achieved by altering one random precinct on some district borders and switching it to the other district. Next, we calculate \\text{score}(g') \\text{score}(g') and compare it to \\text{score}(g) \\text{score}(g) . Let r r describe the ratio of the two scores, where r = {{\\text{score}(g')}\\over{\\text{score}(g)}} r = {{\\text{score}(g')}\\over{\\text{score}(g)}} . If r > 1 r > 1 : Accept the new g' g' and set g = g' g = g' . Increment t t by 1 and repeat this algorithm. For all cases where r \\leq 1 r \\leq 1 , we define a u u to be a random value between 0 0 and 1 1 . If r \\leq 1 r \\leq 1 and r \\geq u r \\geq u : Accept the new g' g' and set g = g' g = g' . Increment t t by 1 and repeat this algorithm. The first check could just be skipped, and the only required comparison is u u and r r , but for the sake of thoroughness it was included in the explanation. If r \\leq 1 r \\leq 1 and r \\lt u r \\lt u : Reject g' g' and increment t t by 1 and repeat this algorithm. Step 5: Determine if a Walk is Complete Typically, the algorithm before will run for \"a while,\" defining precisely when it has run \"long enough\" requires analysis of the sequence of redistrictings 2 that have been produced by the Metropolis Algorithm 1 detailed above. When each item in the redistricting sequence is independent of the previous redistrictings (essentially, when the sequence is random), the algorithm is considered to have run \"long enough\". Defining a Statistical Test for Randomness If we define a new sequence as a sequence of the number of land locked districts in the same order as the redistricting sequence created by the metropolis algorithm, we could perform a statistical test to see that the sequence was random. Specifically, to see that the previous item in a sequence does not affect the next item in the sequence. This was done with a Chi squared test.
